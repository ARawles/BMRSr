# BMRSr

The goal of BMRSr is to provide wrapper functions to better make use of the Balancing Mechanism Reporting System API.

## Installation

You can install the released version of BMRSr from [GitHub](https://github.com/ARawles/BMRSr) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("BMRSr")
```

## Example

You can use the build_x_call functions to create the appropriate URL for your API request.

```{r example}
## This creates an API request to retrieve the B1720 flow on 1st Jan 2018, Settlement Period 1
build_b_call(data_item = "B1720", api_key = "12345", settlement_date = '1 Jan 2018', settlement_period = "1")
```
